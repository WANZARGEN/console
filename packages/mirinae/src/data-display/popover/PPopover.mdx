## Boundary And Width

<br/>
<br/>
When the ```width```prop is set as a percentage, it is designed to be influenced by the width of the parent element with ```position: relative``` which is originally the root element of this component. <br/>
But if you set the ```boundary``` prop, the width would be influenced by the boundary element, so you MUST set ```position: relative``` to the boundary element yourself. <br/>
```boundary``` prop is the string value of the query selector of the boundary element. <br/>
<br/>
However, in this example, the element appears to go beyond the boundaries of the parent element. <br/>
This is an issue with the internal library([FloatingUI](https://floating-ui.com/docs/getting-started)) not adapting to Storybook's iFrame, but it does not cause any issues in actual usage. <br/>
You can check the related issue through [this link](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/issues/2174).
